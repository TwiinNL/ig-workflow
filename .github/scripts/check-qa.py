"""Fail on every publisher error that is not listed in known-errors.txt.

Two sources, because the publisher reports validation errors in qa.xml but errors from
checking the generated HTML (e.g. WCAG heading checks) only in qa.txt and qa.json:
- output/qa.xml (a Bundle of OperationOutcomes). Each error/fatal issue becomes one line
  "<location>: <message>", where location is the issue's expression (e.g.
  ImplementationGuide/<id>), or else the file name.
- output/qa.txt. Each "ERROR:" / "FATAL:" line becomes "<location>: <message>", with the
  absolute path of the output folder replaced by "output/" so the lines do not depend on
  the machine.
The errors of both sources, counted once when both report them, must equal "errs" in
output/qa.json. Lines are compared exactly with the non-comment lines of known-errors.txt.
